1	an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
0	an awful snooze . 
0	if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
0	belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
1	witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
0	neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
1	despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
0	it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
0	works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
1	visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
1	there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him . 
0	the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
0	in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
1	the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
0	the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .

1	a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
1	at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
0	there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
0	while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
0	even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
0	has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
0	gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
1	at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
0	sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
1	cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
0	this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
1	if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
1	ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
0	both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
0	despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
0	a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
1	there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
1	like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
0	although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
1	this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
1	the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
0	strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
0	[carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
0	none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
1	an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
0	de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .

1	one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
1	for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
1	an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
0	an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
0	offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
0	the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
1	tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
1	a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
0	a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
0	what we get . . . is caddyshack crossed with the loyal order of raccoons . 
1	the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache .

1	made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
0	try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
0	rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
1	weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
1	you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
1	it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 
1	jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
0	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .

0	despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
0	an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
1	an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
0	this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago .

0	the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
0	enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
1	this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms .

0	 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
1	feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
0	i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
1	insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances .

1	it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
1	though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
1	as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
1	despite besson's high-profile name being wasabi's big selling point , there is no doubt that krawczyk deserves a huge amount of the credit for the film's thoroughly winning tone .

1	ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
1	liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image .

0	for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
0	it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
0	i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere .

1	there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
0	a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
0	 . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
0	the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
0	director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ?

0	what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
1	real women have curves doesn't offer any easy answers . 
0	predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .

1	not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
0	high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

1	a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
1	it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert .

1	in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
1	much smarter and more attentive than it first sets out to be . 
0	what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
0	behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
0	an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
1	novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach .

0	seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
0	a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
1	the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
1	an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
1	while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel .

1	throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
0	consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
0	the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course .

0	the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
0	these characters become wearisome . 
1	like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series .

0	the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
1	with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
1	to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much .

1	 . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
1	in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
1	the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen .

1	the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
1	even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy .

1	there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
1	the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling .

0	as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction .
